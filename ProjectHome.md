smtp2web consists of an admin interface, written for App Engine, and an SMTP server daemon, which together accept email for configured addresses and send the emails via HTTP POST to user-selected URLs.

This allows web apps such as those written on App Engine, which are traditionally unable to receive email, to do so.

[smtp2web.com](http://www.smtp2web.com/) provides this as a free-to-use service.
